# My Custom QTILE
This is my custom qtile source code. Changed it a little.\
Default terminal is set to Alacritty.\
I should say that this guide and configuration works only with xorg.\
Hope you enjoy.\
### How To Use It??
For using it you have to just run these codes in terminal : 

#### For Arch Linux
If you already don't have pulseaudio installed
You should run this command:
> sudo pacman -S pulseaudio

> sudo pacman -S coreutils git bc libpulse playerctl amixer feh flameshot scrot gawk qtile alacritty acpilight

If you haven't install xfce or any other popular desktop environments by default\
You should run this command: 
> sudo pacman -S libnotify dunst

Press Y to install the packages.

#### After writing those command do this :
> mkdir -p ~/.config/qtile
> git clone https://github.com/arshiaas1973/My-Custom-QTILE.git -o ~/.config/qtile
